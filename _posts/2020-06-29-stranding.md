Death Stranding is a bad game.  I was suckered into getting it because
everyone said 'It's a Kojima game!'  He's apparently good.  Also it
uses the Horizon: Zero Dawn engine, so should look great.  But alas,
it is bad.

There are two interesting aspects of the game:

* What if you had to figure out how to pack all of your loot?  And it
  affected your gait?

* What if rain meant more than the world getting wet?

The first is an interesting mechanic.  Here, the physics of being
loaded up with boxes of various masses affects how you walk.  I mean,
you can still carry an unrealistic amount of stuff.  But you become
ungainly if you have a lot -- and walking up and down hills can be
difficult.  So, in DS, you're a courier carting stuff around a
post-apocalptic wilderness.

The second aspect is that rain is effectively acidic, it starts
destroying your packages and equipment.  You want to avoid it.

Being a future UPS guy is not really enough to hang a game on.  It
lacks sufficient hook.  But you know, some might like it.  There is a
bit of a mystery about the apocalyptic event.  But it's only a puzzle
to you, all the NPCs know.

Let's get to the problems.

* Too much exposition.  In the first few minutes of game play, you get
  many new terms and concepts.  You can't remember it all.  Extra
  Credit has an episode about this, using SkyRim as an example.  In
  that game, you get a pile of politics on the way to be executed at
  the very beginning.  This continues throughout the game, sometimes
  even repeating the exposition &mdash; yes, you just told me that,
  why are you telling me again?

* So many cut scenes.  These are just painful.  Plus, sometimes they
  are unskipable.  Sometimes you press the pause button to get to a
  'continue or skip' dialog.  Sometimes you press square to do that,
  and sometimes you press circle.  Sometimes you just pause and
  unpause. Why is there no f'in' consistency?

* The menu system is a failing grade.  You spend a lot of time in the
  menu system.  Deciding which missions to accept.  Figuring out where
  to stash your stuff.  But it's insanely complicated, essentially
  driven by press-square or press-and-hold-square &mdash; rather than,
  say two different buttons.  If you try and back out of something, a
  'do you want to cancel' dialog pops up, with &mdash; you guessed it
  &mdash; 'ok' and 'cancel' options.  I mean, that was known broken in
  the '80s!

* Route planning.  It is not intuitive at all.  The route
  planning is difficult, you only get a 5 line segments to lay down.
  You can't drop a line consisting of multiple vertices.

* Base interactions.  The menu opens up again at the various bases, to
  deliver things, accept tasks, loadup with stuff, make things.
  Sometimes after drilling down to accept a mission or load up
  something, you drop out of the menu (and have to re-enable the
  interaction to continue).

* Upgrading.  Randomly, after accepting a mission, the powers that be
  my give you a more powerful weopon or other tool.  It's like 'we've
  upgraded your gun to version 2, no reason'.  It's not like you even
  find new plans, or deliver something to 'the engineer'.

* Stupid names.  Character names are idiotic.  'deadman', 'the
  engineer', 'fragile', 'diehardman'.  The last ne essentially treats
  you as his pet dog &mdash; 'Go fetch that!'

* Story-breaking communication.  The game arc as you rescuing a
  estranged-sister? ex-wife? (not sure).  She's been kidnapped by
  baddies.  But for some reason you can openly communicate with her
  and talk about the escape. WTF are these kidnappers thinking?

* Unskippable death.  The death sequence is horrific.  And you can't
  skip it to get to the loading screen.  I've taken to turning the TV
  off, when this occurs, and then wait for the controller to stop
  vibrating.  There are a few other places you can't get to the
  loading menu.

* Halfway through the 3rd act, you're given a device to deliver.  If
  you deliver it, you fail.  With no clue.  The only way to succeed is
  to, half way through the mission, call into your 'safe room'.  You
  use your safe room to recharge, there's no other need to visit it
  &mdash; so why would you do that in the middle of a mission?  That's
  just bad plotting, you have to google for what to do.

* Construction.  You get to build roads.  That's kind of fun.  For a
  bit.  But then they need the usual more and more resources for later
  roads, and all that happens is you end up slogging up and down those
  roads, rather than trampling over foot paths.  Yay!

* Like many of the reviewers, I have Stockholm syndrome.

Oh, and it doesn't look as pretty as Horizon:Zero Dawn.
